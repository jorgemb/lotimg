# lotimg
_lotimg_ is a Python 3 tool useful for applying a series of transformations to a batch of images.
Current supported transformations are:
* Dimensions change (all images to the same size)
* Name change (using custom python code)
* Format change (JPG, GIF, BMP, PNG, TIFF)

## Backstory
This project was made in 2011 for an introductory class on Python2.7 received in Universidad del Valle de Guatemala.
Was my first introduction to graphical user interfaces and Python, and I loved it since (though not a big fan of GUIs).
The first version was crude and made with a team of fellow students, however I rewrote it from scratch at the end of the
term because I saw potential for it to be used as an everyday tool. On 2018 I ported it to Python3 and uploaded it to
GitHub.
